					The Degroof Petercam Foundation supports education by helping to reduce the number of school dropouts.
					The main focus is on children from low-come families and who are socially disadvantaged.
					That’s why we’re contributing to quality, equitable education by supporting students with:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Coaching and guidance</li>
						<li>Encouragement</li>
						<li>Information about new skills that they'll need in the future</li>
						<li>Reassessment of technical and vocational education</li>
					</ul>

				<p>
					And teachers with:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Coaching and guidance</li>
						<li>Encouragement</li>
						<li>Revaluation of the teaching profession</li>
						<li>Informational and educational workshops</li>

					Entrepreneurship was selected as the second priority pillar because the Foundation is convinced
					that the creation of enterprises is an effective and measurable solution to the economic challenges
					facing future generations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Foundation aims to encourage the creation of businesses and job creation by:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Highlighting entrepreneurship and the role of the entrepreneur</li>
						<li>Promoting entrepreneurship among young people</li>
						<li>Supporting new initiatives to boost entrepreneurship</li>
